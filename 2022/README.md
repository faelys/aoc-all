This repository contains my attempts at solving
the [Advent of Code this year (2022)][1].

I tried for the first last year, and it was fun, so I'm doing it
again in 2022. This time, I'm using the opportunity to explore
stack-based languages, starting with PostScriptÂ 3 which seems to
be the most beginner-friendly.
