This repository contains my attempts at solving
the [Advent of Code this year (2022)][1].

I tried for the first last year, and it was fun, so I'm doing it
again in 2022. This time, I'm using the opportunity to explore
stack-based languages, starting with PostScriptÂ 3 which seems to
be the most beginner-friendly.

## Closing Thoughts

Overall it was a fun and interesting discovery.
I was a bit disappointed by the lack of exoticity, especially
compared to my discovery of functional programming in clojure or
SAT solving last year. However the familiarity was welcome, it
reminded me of my early years in programming (in 386 assembly),
especially when debugging my running the program in my head and
comparing with actual outputs to find out which assumption of mine
didn't hold.
