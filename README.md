This repository contains my almost all my attempts at solving
the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I tried for the first time in 2021, using a formal modelling language,
accepted by a proprietary toolchain in my workplace, so this is not
interesting or relevant enough for archival and sharing.

Since then I've used Advent of Code as an excuse to exercise new
programming languages, or languages I feel I don't know well enough:

 - 2024: [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
 - 2023: [CHICKEN Scheme](https://call-cc.org/)
 - 2022: [PostScriptÂ 3](https://www.adobe.com/jp/print/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf)
